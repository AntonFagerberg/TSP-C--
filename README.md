Travelling Salesman Problem "solver" in C++

We had a friendly competition at Jayway where I work of who could get the best result in different instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem. I wrote my solver in C++ to refresh my knowledge there an it worked fairly well. I quickly achieved very good results on the smaller instances but had problems dealing with instances with 10,000 nodes.
